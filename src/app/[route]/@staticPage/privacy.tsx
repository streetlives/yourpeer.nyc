            <h2>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</h2>
            <p>
              Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
              For that reason, we do not allow children under 13 years of age to

              time or in any manner. If we learn that information has been

              your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may
              not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any
              of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We are not
              responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security

            <h2>Do Not Track Disclosures:</h2>
            <p>
              Third parties such as advertising networks, analytics providers,
              and widget providers may collect information about your online
              activities over time and across different websites when you access
              or use our Services. Currently, various browsers offer a “Do Not
              Track” option, but there is no standard for how DNT should work on
              commercial websites. Due to lack of such standards, the Site does
              not respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings.
